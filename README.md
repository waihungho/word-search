<p>Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.<br/>
The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where adjacent cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring.<br/>
The same letter cell may not be used more than once.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Input The board to be used may be hard coded as:<br/>
 [<br/>
 [ABCE],<br/>
 [SFCS],<br/>
 [ADEE]<br/>
 ]<br/>
</p>
<p>
Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line in this file contains a word.<br/>
 e.g.<br/>
 ASADB<br/>
 ABCCED<br/>
 ABCF<br/>
 </p>
<p>
Output
 Print out True if the word exists in the board, False otherwise.<br/>
 e.g<br/>
 False<br/>
 True<br/>
 False<br/>
</p>
